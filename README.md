# LeetCode Solutions Documentation

This repository contains my solutions and detailed explanations for various LeetCode problems, implemented in Python using Jupyter notebooks. The notebooks include visual explanations, code implementations, and helpful images for understanding data structures and algorithms concepts.

## Repository Structure

└── README.md
```

## Notebook Format
Each problem solution is documented in a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) with the following structure:

1. Problem Statement & Examples
2. Visual Explanations & Diagrams
3. Approach Discussion
4. Python Implementation
5. Time & Space Complexity Analysis
6. Test Cases & Results

## Getting Started
1. Navigate to the appropriate difficulty folder (easy/medium/hard)
2. Open the notebook for the problem you're interested in
3. Each notebook is self-contained with problem description, approach, and solution

## Running the Notebooks
Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook/Lab
- Required Python packages (if any) will be listed at the start of each notebook

To run the notebooks:
```bash
jupyter notebook
# or
jupyter lab
```

## Naming Convention
Notebooks follow the naming convention:
`L[Problem_Number]_[Problem_Name].ipynb`
Example: L1_TwoSum.ipynb, L733_FloodFill.ipynb

## Features
- Visual explanations with images and diagrams
- Step-by-step approach breakdowns
- Interactive code cells for testing
- Comprehensive problem analysis
- Clean and consistent formatting
