# LeetCode Solutions Documentation

This repository contains my solutions and detailed explanations for various LeetCode problems. Each solution is implemented in Python and includes a thorough explanation of the approach, time complexity, and space complexity.

## Repository Structure

```
├── problems/
│   ├── easy/
│   ├── medium/
│   └── hard/
└── README.md
```

## Solution Format
Each problem solution will be documented in its own directory under the appropriate difficulty level folder with the following structure:

```
problems/[difficulty]/[problem-number]-[problem-name]/
├── README.md (Problem description and approach)
└── solution.py (Python implementation)
```

### Solution README Template
Each problem's README.md should include:
1. Problem Statement
2. Examples
3. Approach & Explanation
4. Time Complexity
5. Space Complexity
6. Additional Notes (if any)

## Getting Started
1. Navigate to the problem difficulty folder (easy/medium/hard)
2. Each problem has its own folder with a detailed README and solution
3. Solutions are implemented in Python 3

## Running the Solutions
To run any solution:
```bash
python problems/[difficulty]/[problem-number]-[problem-name]/solution.py
```
